# Amalgam
## ARCHIVED > New Repo is here: https://github.com/GreenAnts/Online_Amalgam
A two player (competitive) abstract strategy game that requires you to tactically utilize your pieces  in conjunction with one another to either eliminate the opponents pieces or carefully get a valuable piece to the other side of the board.

>Currently playtesting is being done via screentop.gg, Tabletop Simulator, and our discord server. The end goal is to create a online multiplayer platform to allow players to make an account and get matched with other players. Eventually we would love to add ranked play, rules/mechanics enforcement, and etc. This repository is a (slow) work in progress to make that happen.

| -------- | --------- |
| [Join Our Discord](https://discord.gg/gKHjJNBWAd) | We hope to build a playtesting community to refine our game. Due to the very technical nature of the game, we believe we need as much playtesting as we can get in order to create balanced rules thatare also enjoyable to play. Additionally, the community will hopefully act as a way to find other players and share strategies. |
| [Rules Document](https://imgur.com/a/amalgam-board-game-rules-0lTmlgR) | As we iterate on the game and make changes to the rules, the newest version of the rules document can be found here.|
| [Website](https://www.amalgamboardgame.com/) | This is basically another way to read the rules, that are possibly more accessible. |
| [Tabletop Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1402132394&searchtext=amalgam)  | A 3D tabletop experience as an alternative to SCREENTOP.GG - NOTE: The Tabletop Simulator Application is a paid software. |
| [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/LZD5h4siXVM) | Reading the rules not your thing? Or maybe you read the rules but you are still confused...Try watching the video walk through to get a better understanding. |
| [A short story of our journey so far](https://www.patreon.com/posts/amalgam-board-113134314?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link) |  Before starting back up on this project again, I wrote up a short article about our LONG journey of trying to make this game a reality. It's been about 10 years since I first designed the initial idea of this project, and hopefully it will soon finally become a reality!|
